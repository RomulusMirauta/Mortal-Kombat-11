## 1. Tutorial_Input scripts

*STEAM Link: https://store.steampowered.com/app/976310/Mortal_Kombat_11/*

### **Purpose:** to simulate human-like input - that is not recognised by game's engine as being script-generated / is read or recognised by game's engine, being inputed at a ~normal rate

### **Problem solved:** while going through MK11's Tutorial (advanced parts), I came to the conclusion that the game's engine cannot actually keep with fast-paced input, leading to the impossibility of completing certain Tutorial parts

### How to use:
1. download this archive and unarchive it [Tutorial_Input_Compiled_Scripts.zip](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RomulusMirauta/Mortal-Kombat-11/main/Tutorial_Input/compiled/Tutorial_Input_Compiled_Scripts.zip)
2. start Mortal Kombat 11
3. from the Main Menu, go to: Learn - Tutorial - choose the desired Tutorial
4. open the folder containing the scripts, choose the script and start it
5. go back to MK11's window and **wait** *(the script will* ***Activate*** *automatically)* **OR** press **F1** in order to trigger the script **once** *(exercise the timing)*
6. after completing each problematic challenge, Exit/Close the script

*TI = Tutorial Input<br>
**The number after "TI" indicates the problematic Tutorial Challenge - the first script (MK11-Tutorial_Input-01.exe) is for the following ~impossible Tutorial Challenge: Frame Data - Punishing - challenge no.4 *(the scripts that follow after are for the next ~impossible challenges, in ascending order)*<br>
***Press `F3` to **Pause** the script<br>
****Press `F4` to **Exit/Close** the script<br>

<br>Before creating these AHK Scripts, I've tried these, which ultimately failed to solve the encountered issue:
- utilized a bunch of gaming keyboards - wired (so the input latency would be way lower), with mechanical and hybrid switches, some even with short-stroke keys (to increase the chance of hitting the combo)
- simulated a controller - through Steam Link Android app - with different and custom key positions *(https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.valvesoftware.steamlink)*
- *last step would have been this, but it did not happen...being stubborn by nature and also being reluctant to buying a physical controller due to reading (a lot of) bad reviews, and discussions that I had with controller owners*

### Proof that these scripts actually worked, at least for me: https://steamcommunity.com/id/ILimitlessI/stats/976310/?tab=achievements

## 2. Farming_Towers scripts

### **Purpose:** to simulate a human-like simple input - continuously pressing the `Enter` key *(only when MK11 window is focused)*

### **Problem solved:** in Mortal Kombat 11, the resources require a lot of grinding => this will help you automatically farm resources

<br>**This script will help you grind the ***Tower-related*** achievements, ultimately adding Mortal Kombat 11 to your Steam's "Perfect Games" list, by collecting all of the achievements** ***(100%, 58 out of 58).***
<br><br>

Steam Achievements impacted by Kompletion of Tower-grinding:
- Klassic (Komplete a Novice, Warrior, or Champion Klassic Tower once)
- I Want It All (Komplete the Novice, Warrior, or Champion Klassic Towers with 10 different characters)
- Tower Champion (Komplete 125 Towers)
- Master of Time (Komplete 250 Towers)

### How to use:
1. download and start the script from here: [MK11-Farming_Towers_Final.exe](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RomulusMirauta/Mortal-Kombat-11/main/Farming_Towers/MK11-Farming_Towers_Final.exe)
2. start Mortal Kombat 11
3. from the Main Menu, go to: Konquer - Klassic Towers/Towers of Time - choose a Tower (e.g. Endless Tower) - choose any fighter - choose the Fighter to be AI-controlled *(for keyboard: press `A` key)*
4. Press `F1` in order to **Activate** the script
5. *watch and enjoy*

*From time to time, check if you lost the fight<br>
**Press `F3` to **Pause** the script<br>
***Press `F4` to **Exit/Close** the script<br>

## 3. Shrine_Farming scripts

### INFO: "MK11 - Guide to Shrine Rewards in the Krypt" *(not mine)* <br> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubQo1a_EKz4

### **Purpose:** to simulate a human-like input - in order to continuously spend Koins *(key sequence triggers only when MK11 window is focused)*

### **Problem solved:** the spending process takes quite a while => this will help you (automatically) spend Koins

<br>**This script will help you grind the ***Shrine-related*** and other achievements, ultimately adding Mortal Kombat 11 to your Steam's "Perfect Games" list, by collecting all of the achievements** ***(100%, 58 out of 58).***
<br><br>

Steam Achievements impacted by Kompletion of Shrine-grinding:
- Gimme Dat Money (Spend 50,000 koins in the Naknadan shrine)
- More Power (Use 50 Konsumables)
- Konsumed (Use 100 consumables)

### How to use:

2. start Mortal Kombat 11
3. from the Main Menu, go to: Konquer - Krypt
4. go to the Shrine
5. activate the script
   - Press `F1` in order to initiate the spending of **1.000** Koins *(minimum amount)* - mostly for farming: 1x kombat kard
   - Press `F2` in order to initiate the spending of **10.000** Koins - mostly for farming: 2x kombat kards
   - Press `F3` in order to initiate the spending of **15.000** Koins - mostly for farming: 1x augment & 1x *%random item%*
   - Press `F4` in order to initiate the spending of **75.000** Koins - mostly for farming: 2x gears (or 2x augments - very rare occurrence)
   - Press `F5` in order to initiate the spending of **100.000** Koins *(maximum amount)* - mostly for farming: 1x skin
7. *observe the wealth disappearing into the Smoke*

*Press `F7` to **Pause** the script<br>
**Press `F8` to **Reload** the script *(to be used in case of script becoming unresponsive - it can happen after Pausing the script)*<br>
  After Reloading the Script, you will need to activate it again by pressing `F1`-`F5` keys<br>
***Press `F9` to **Exit/Close** the script<br>
