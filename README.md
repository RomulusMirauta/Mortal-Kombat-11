## 1. Tutorial_Input

*STEAM Link: https://store.steampowered.com/app/976310/Mortal_Kombat_11/*

### **Purpose:** to simulate human-like input - that is not recognised by game's engine as being script-generated / is read or recognised by game's engine, being inputed at a ~normal rate

### **Problem solved:** while going through MK11's Tutorial (advanced parts), I came to the conclusion that the game's engine cannot actually keep with fast-paced input, leading to the impossibility of completing certain Tutorial parts

### How to use:
1. download this archive and unarchive it [Tutorial_Input_Compiled_Scripts.zip](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RomulusMirauta/Mortal-Kombat-11/main/Tutorial_Input/compiled/Tutorial_Input_Compiled_Scripts.zip)
2. start Mortal Kombat 11
3. from the Main Menu, go to: Learn - Tutorial - choose the desired Tutorial
4. go to Desktop, choose the script and start it
5. go back to MK11's window and **wait** *(the script will Activate automatically)*
6. after completing each problematic challenge, Exit/Close the script

*TI = Tutorial Input<br>
**The number after "TI" indicates the problematic Tutorial Challenge<br>
***Press **F3** to **Pause** the script<br>
****Press **F4** to **Exit/Close** the script<br>

<br>Before creating these AHK Scripts, I've tried these, which ultimately failed to solve the encountered issue:
- utilized a bunch of gaming keyboards - wired (so the input latency would be way lower), with mechanical and hybrid switches, some even with short-stroke keys (to increase the chance of hitting the combo)
- simulated a controller - through Steam Link Android app - with different and custom key positions *(https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.valvesoftware.steamlink)*
- *last step would have been this, but it did not happen...being stubborn by nature and also being reluctant to buying a physical controller due to reading (a lot of) bad reviews, and discussions that I had with controller owners*

### Proof that these scripts actually worked, at least for me: https://steamcommunity.com/id/ILimitlessI/stats/976310/?tab=achievements

## 2. Farming_Towers

### **Purpose:** to simulate a human-like simple input - continuously pressing the "Enter" key *(only when MK11 window is focused)*

### **Problem solved:** in Mortal Kombat 11, the resources require a lot of grinding => this will help you automatically farm resources

### How to use:
1. download and start the script from here: [MK11-FarmingTowers1.exe](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RomulusMirauta/Mortal-Kombat-11/main/Farming_Towers/MK11-FarmingTowers1.exe)
2. start Mortal Kombat 11
3. from the Main Menu, go to: Konquer - Klassic Towers/Towers of Time - choose a Tower (e.g. Endless Tower) - choose any fighter - choose the Fighter to be AI-controlled *(for keyboard: press "A" button)*
4. Press **F1** in order to **Activate** the script
5. *watch and enjoy*

*From time to time, check if you lost the fight<br>
**Press **F3** to **Pause** the script<br>
***Press **F4** to **Exit/Close** the script<br>

## 3. Shrine_Farmer

### MK11 - Guide to Shrine Rewards in the Krypt *(not mine)* <br> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubQo1a_EKz4

### **Purpose:** to simulate a human-like simple input - continuously pressing the "Enter" key *(only when MK11 window is focused)*

### **Problem solved:** in Mortal Kombat 11, the resources require a lot of grinding => this will help you (automatically) farm resources

### How to use:
1. download and start the script from here: [MK11-ShrineFarmer1.exe](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RomulusMirauta/Mortal-Kombat-11/main/Shrine_Farmer/MK11-ShrineFarmer1.exe)
2. start Mortal Kombat 11
3. from the Main Menu, go to: Konquer - Krypt
4. go to the Shrine
5. Press **F1** in order to **Activate** the script
6. *observe the wealth disappearing into the Smoke*

*Press **F3** to **Pause** the script<br>
**Press **F4** to **Exit/Close** the script<br>
***Press **F5** to **Reload** the script *(to be used in case of script becoming unresponsive - it can happen after Pausing the script)*<br>
  After Reloading the Script, you will need to Activate it again by pressing F1<br>
