# **Mortal Kombat 11 AHK Scripts**

## 1. Tutorial_Input

### **Purpose:** to simulate human-like input - that is not recognised by game's engine as being script-generated / is read or recognised by game's engine, being inputed at a ~normal rate

### **Problem solved:** while going through MK11's Tutorial (advanced parts), I came to the conclusion that the game's engine cannot actually keep with fast-paced input, leading to the impossibility of completing certain Tutorial parts

Before creating these AHK Scripts, I've tried these, which ultimately failed to solve the encountered issue:
- utilized a bunch of gaming keyboards - wired (so the input latency would be way lower), with mechanical and hybrid switches, some even with short-stroke keys (to increase the chance of hitting the combo)
- simulated a controller - through Steam Link Android app - with different and custom key positions *(https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.valvesoftware.steamlink)*
- *last step would have been this, but it did not happen...being stubborn by nature and also being reluctant to buying a physical controller due to reading (a lot of) bad reviews, and discussions that I had with controller owners*

### Proof that these scripts actually worked, at least for me: https://steamcommunity.com/id/ILimitlessI/stats/976310/?tab=achievements
